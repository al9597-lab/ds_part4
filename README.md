# NYU Database Systems – Project Part IV  
### AI Document Processing Pipeline with PostgreSQL Integration

---

## 🚀 Overview
This project implements **Part IV** of the NYU Database Systems course project.

The goal is to:
1️⃣ Load unstructured health-related documents from PostgreSQL  
2️⃣ Run a pretrained **DistilBERT disease classification model**  
3️⃣ Predict patient risk and disease category  
4️⃣ Store AI inference results back into PostgreSQL  

This demonstrates how **Machine Learning integrates with database systems** in a real architecture.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
PostgreSQL (unstructured_document) → Python Pipeline → DistilBERT Model → PostgreSQL (document_inference)

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration
Create `.env` in project root:

PG_HOST=localhost  
PG_PORT=5432  
PG_USER=postgres  
PG_PASSWORD=******  
PG_DB=insdb  

MODEL_PATH=models/distilbert_chronic_disease  
MODEL_VERSION=distilbert_v1  

---

## 📦 Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## ▶️ Run Pipeline
python main.py

Expected output:
Processing X documents...  
Pipeline completed.

---

## 🧪 Verify Results in PostgreSQL
SELECT * FROM document_inference;

---

## 🤖 Model Notes
Model is a **fine-tuned DistilBERT classifier**
Predicts:
Diabetes  
Cardiovascular Disease  
Respiratory Disease  

Model weights are **NOT uploaded to GitHub** due to size (>250MB)
They remain stored locally and are referenced via MODEL_PATH
